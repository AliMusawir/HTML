            <h3>Restaurant Management System</h3>
           
            <p>The restaurant management system will start from the login as administrator (credential can be admin and
                password). On the second screen, there will be a dashboard that will have an e-menu card. The admin will
                select the items as per the choice of customers. The items' prices will be selected automatically. The
                admin will only insert the quantity per item. Furthermore, the admin can change the prices, add new items,
                delete existing items, and modify the prices.</p>

            <h3>Super Store Management System</h3>
            <p>Upon observing our surroundings, we noticed that many local and yet-growing superstore owners are still
                working manually, using registers and journals to maintain their routine data. The owners of non-well-known
                superstores (which are many in number) are either unaware of the database management system or choose not
                to implement that into their businesses for one of the reasons to be complex to use.</p>
